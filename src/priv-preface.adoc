[colophon]
== Preface
// Had to make the above a level 1 heading (two equals signs) to avoid error when building
// the ISA manual as a book with other "parts". This is opposite to what the adoc says to do
// but otherwise asciidoctor creates the error message:
//
// asciidoctor: ERROR: ext/riscv-isa-manual/src/priv-preface.adoc: line 2: invalid part, must have at least one section (e.g., chapter, appendix, etc.)
//
// See asciidoctor doc which seems wrong: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/colophon/
